## Overview

Upload documentation attachments for applications using a three-step process:
1. **Create Upload URL**: Request a signed URL
2. **Upload File**: PUT file to the signed URL
3. **Commit Upload**: Finalize the attachment

<Note>
- `application_id` comes from the **query parameter**, not the request body
- The signed upload URL expires quickly (typically 60 seconds)
- The `path` in commit must match the path from create upload URL response
</Note>

<Warning>
Make sure to upload and commit the file before the signed URL expires, or request a new upload URL.
</Warning>

For detailed workflow explanation, storage paths, attachment types, and best practices, see the [Attachments Workflow section](/api-reference/guides/api-guide#attachments-workflow) in the API Guide.

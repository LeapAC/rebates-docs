## Overview

Calculate incentives across multiple utility programs for a customer address and device. This endpoint automatically handles customer creation, utility lookup, and incentive aggregation.

Use **lookup** for first-time customers (requires full address) or **refresh** for returning customers (faster, uses cached data).

<Note>
The `reference_id` is **required** and must be unique. It enables faster lookups on subsequent calls.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Performance Tip**: Use `operation_type="refresh"` for returning customers to skip geocoding and use cached utility data. This is significantly faster than lookup operations.
</Tip>

For more details on operation types, organization scoping, and best practices, see the [API Guide](/api-reference/guides/api-guide).

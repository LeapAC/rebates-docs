## Overview

Calculate incentives across multiple utility programs for a customer address and device. This endpoint automatically handles customer creation, utility lookup, and incentive aggregation.

The API supports three operation types:

- **`lookup`**: First-time customers or when you need fresh utility data (requires full address and `device_ids`)
- **`refresh`**: Returning customers using cached utilities (fastest, only requires `reference_id`)
- **`override`**: Replace all customer devices with new ones, then refresh calculation

<Tip>
**Performance Tip**: Use `operation_type="refresh"` for returning customers to skip geocoding and use cached utility data. You can even omit `device_ids` to use all existing devices automatically.
</Tip>

For detailed operation type behavior, device ID handling, and best practices, see the [Incentives API Guide](/incentives-guide).

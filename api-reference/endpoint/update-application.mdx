## Overview

Update application fields, customer information, and customer devices. Use `dryRun=true` as a query parameter to validate the request without applying changes.

<Tip>
**Customer Devices**: Each device in `customer_devices` must include `id` (required, not optional). Missing `id` will return a 400 Bad Request error.
</Tip>

For more details on dry run mode and best practices, see the [API Guide](/api-reference/guides/api-guide).

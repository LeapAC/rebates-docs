description: 'Bulk update applications using reference ID. Supports updating customer information, customer devices, and application fields.'

<Note>
This endpoint does **not** require API key authentication. It uses the anonymous key and identifies applications via the `refID` query parameter.

Use the `refID` query parameter to specify which application(s) to update. The `refID` corresponds to the `reference_id` field used when creating applications.

Set `dryRun=true` to validate the request without applying changes.
</Note>

## Bulk Updates

This endpoint supports updating multiple applications in a single request by providing an array of application objects in the request body. All updates are processed within a single transaction.

## Reference ID

The `refID` query parameter is used to identify the application(s) to update. This should match the `reference_id` that was provided when the application was initially created via the Connect URL flow.

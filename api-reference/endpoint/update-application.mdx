## Overview

Update application fields, customer information, and customer devices. Use `dryRun=true` as a query parameter to validate the request without applying changes.

<Note>
**Status Transitions**: By default, status changes must follow forward progress:
`not_started` → `in_progress` → `awaiting_partner` → `completed` → `submitted` → `approved` / `rejected`

To override (e.g., move backward), include the `X-Force-Status: true` header.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Customer Devices**: Each device in `customer_devices` must include `id` (required, not optional). Missing `id` will return a 400 Bad Request error.
</Tip>

For more details on status transitions, dry run mode, and best practices, see the [API Guide](/api-reference/guides/api-guide).

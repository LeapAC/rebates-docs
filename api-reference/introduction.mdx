## How It Works

Given a customer address and building type, the Leap API:

1. Identifies the utility serving the address
2. Finds all active programs for that utility and building type
3. Calculates incentive amounts for eligible devices
4. Returns aggregated results across all programs

## Integration Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Eligibility">
  Use the GET /incentives endpoint to check what programs and incentive amounts are available for your customer's address and building type.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Application">
  When you find eligible incentives, create an application by including `create_application: true` in your request. This returns a Connect URL for your customer.
</Step>

<Step title="Customer Completes Application">
  Embed the Connect URL in your customer journey (post-purchase email, order confirmation, or app setup flow). The customer completes required forms and uploads documentation.
</Step>

<Step title="Upload Partner Data">
  For applications in `awaiting_partner` status, upload any remaining data requirements using the POST /applications/[id] endpoint to complete the application.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using API keys. Include your Leap API key in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Generate API credentials from your partner dashboard for both sandbox and production environments.

## Overview

The Applications API allows you to query and monitor rebate applications throughout their lifecycle. You can search and retrieve application data to track progress and integrate with your systems.

For detailed endpoint specifications, see the Applications API reference pages:
- [Search Applications](/api-reference/endpoint/search-applications)
- [Get Application](/api-reference/endpoint/get-application)

## Application Status Workflow

Applications follow a defined status progression:

```
not_started → in_progress → awaiting_partner → completed → submitted → approved/rejected
```

### Status Definitions

- **`not_started`**: Application created but work hasn't begun
- **`in_progress`**: Application is being actively worked on
- **`awaiting_partner`**: Waiting on external partner (installer, utility, etc.)
- **`completed`**: All work finished, ready for submission
- **`submitted`**: Application submitted to utility/program administrator
- **`approved`**: Application approved, rebate processing
- **`rejected`**: Application rejected (see rejection details in application data)

## Search vs Get Application

The API provides two ways to retrieve application data, optimized for different use cases:

### Search Applications (`GET /applications`)

- Returns simplified application data
- Optimized for listing and filtering
- Faster response times
- Supports pagination
- Filter by `refId`, `customer_id`, or `application_status`

**Use when**: You need to list applications, filter by criteria, or build application lists in your UI.

### Get Application (`GET /applications/{id}`)

- Returns complete application data
- Includes all customer fields and customer device details
- Slower but more comprehensive

**Use when**: You need complete details for a specific application, including all nested data.

<Note>
**Recommended pattern**: Use Search Applications for listing and filtering, then use Get Application to retrieve full details when a user selects a specific application.
</Note>

## Attachments

Applications may have associated attachments such as invoices, permits, photos, and other documentation. You can list and download attachments for applications.

For detailed endpoint specifications, see:
- [Upload Attachments](/api-reference/endpoint/attachments)
- [List Attachments](/api-reference/endpoint/list-attachments)
- [Download Attachment](/api-reference/endpoint/download-attachment)

### Attachment Types

Applications support the following attachment types:

- `INVOICE_EQUIPMENT` - Equipment purchase invoice
- `INVOICE_INSTALL` - Installation invoice
- `PERMIT` - Building/electrical permit
- `PHOTO_NAMEPLATE` - Equipment nameplate photo
- `PHOTO_INSTALL` - Installation photo
- `PHOTO_METER` - Utility meter photo
- `AHRI_CERT` - AHRI certification document
- `NEAT_REPORT` - NEAT/SIR report
- `INCOME_FORM` - Income verification form
- `W9` - W-9 tax form
- `OTHER` - Other documentation

### Listing Attachments

List all attachments for one or more applications:

```bash
# List attachments for a single application
curl -X GET "https://api.incentives.leap.energy/alpha/applications/attachments?application_id=123&attachment_type=INVOICE_EQUIPMENT" \
  -H "x-api-key: leap_live_..."

# List all attachments for multiple applications
curl -X GET "https://api.incentives.leap.energy/alpha/applications/attachments?application_ids=123,124,125" \
  -H "x-api-key: leap_live_..."
```

### Downloading Attachments

Get a signed download URL for an attachment (valid for 1 hour):

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.incentives.leap.energy/alpha/applications/attachments/456/download?application_id=123" \
  -H "x-api-key: leap_live_..."
```

The response includes a `downloadUrl` field with a temporary signed URL for downloading the file.

## Common Workflows

### Creating and Tracking Applications

1. **Create via Incentives API**: Use `create_application: true` in the Incentives request
2. **Get the `connect_url`**: Share with customer to complete their application
3. **Monitor progress**: Poll using `GET /applications?refId=customer-123` to track status changes
4. **Retrieve details**: Use `GET /applications/{id}` when you need complete application data

### Monitoring Application Status

Applications are updated internally as they progress through the workflow. You can monitor status changes by:

1. **Polling periodically**: Check application status at regular intervals
2. **Filtering by status**: Use `application_status` parameter to find applications in specific states
3. **Tracking by customer**: Use `refId` or `customer_id` to monitor specific customers' applications

### Example: Finding Applications by Status

```bash
# Find all submitted applications
curl -X GET "https://api.incentives.leap.energy/alpha/applications?application_status=submitted" \
  -H "x-api-key: leap_live_..."

# Find applications for a specific customer
curl -X GET "https://api.incentives.leap.energy/alpha/applications?refId=customer-123" \
  -H "x-api-key: leap_live_..."
```

## Best Practices

### Efficient Querying

- Use Search Applications for lists (faster, paginated)
- Cache application lists and refresh periodically
- Only fetch full details (Get Application) when you need complete data
- Use appropriate `limit` values for pagination (default: 50, max: 100)

### Status Monitoring

- Poll at reasonable intervals (avoid excessive API calls)
- Filter by `application_status` to find applications requiring attention
- Track the `updated_at` timestamp to identify recent changes

### Integration Patterns

- Store the mapping between your system IDs and application IDs
- Use `refId` consistently to link applications to your customers
- Cache application data locally to reduce API calls
- Refresh cached data when you detect status changes

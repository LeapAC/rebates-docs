## What is Leap Rebates?

Leap Rebates is a partner platform that enables retailers, installers, and manufacturers to embed energy rebate applications directly into their customer experience. Instead of customers navigating complex utility programs on their own, you can provide instant eligibility checks and streamlined applications right when they purchase qualifying equipment.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check eligibility">
    Send us your customer's address and device information. We'll instantly check which rebate programs they qualify for and return the total incentive amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Embed the application">
    Display the Connect URL we provide in your checkout flow, confirmation email, or app. Your customer clicks through to complete their application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide supporting data">
    Upload installation details, contractor information, or other data you already have on file. This reduces what customers need to manually enter.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Track applications">
    Monitor application status through our API or dashboard. We handle submission to utility programs and keep you updated on approvals.
  </Step>
</Steps>

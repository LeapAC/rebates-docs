Leap Incentives is a platform that enables partners to embed utility rebates directly into their point of sale and customer experiences. Instead of customers navigating complex utility programs on their own, customers can see their incentive and apply directly from your product.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check eligibility">
    Send customer address and device details. We'll check which rebate programs they qualify for and return the total incentive amount and a URL the customer can use to apply for the rebate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Embed the application">
    Display the Connect URL post-checkout, in a confirmation email, or in app. The customer clicks through to complete their application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide supporting data">
    Upload installation details, contractor information, or other data you already have on file. This reduces what customers need to manually enter.
  </Step>
</Steps>

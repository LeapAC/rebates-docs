title: "Program Roadmap"
description: "Launch timeline for utility rebate programs supported by Leap Energy"
---

## Overview

This roadmap shows our planned program from late 2025 thru early 2026

- **Pilot Phase (Nov-Dec 2025):** Initial utility partners testing our platform with EV charging programs.

- **Q1 2026:** Rapid expansion across major utilities, adding support for EV chargers, vehicle rebates, and panel make-ready programs.

<Note>
We use **EIA names** for utilities, which often break parent companies into their state-specific subsidiaries (e.g., NSTAR Electric Company vs. Eversource, Baltimore Gas & Electric vs. Exelon).

This naming convention better matches the regulatory structure governing rebate programs, where funding and program rules can vary significantly on a state-by-state basis.

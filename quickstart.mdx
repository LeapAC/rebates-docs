## Customer Fills the Application

Customer completes the application in Leap Connect. After completion, application_status is updated to `awaiting_partner` or `completed`.

<Note>
  The customer will provide required documentation and consent for data sharing during this step.
</Note>

## Upload Claimed Fields

Provide information to complete the customer's application.

### Step 1: Search for Applications

Search for applications in `awaiting_partner` status.

```http
GET /applications?application_status=awaiting_partner
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "next_page_token": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "status": "awaiting_partner",
      "customer_id": 609,
      "customer_device_id": [45],
      "customer": {
        "id": 609,
        "address_line1": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Atlanta",
        "state": "GA",
        "zip_code": "30303"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Update Application

Upload partner data using the application ID from the search results.

```http
PATCH /applications/123
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "customer": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "555-1234"
  },
  "customer_devices": [
    {
      "id": 45,
      "purchase_date": "2025-01-15",
      "installation_date": "2025-01-20",
      "contractor_name": "ABC Electric",

## Overview

Build an embedded rebate offer that's unique per customer, plus a LeapConnect flow to complete and submit rebate applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

<Steps>
<Step title="Partner account & API credentials">

</Step>

<Step title="Legal review">
  Complete data privacy & consent review with your legal/ops team.
</Step>

<Step title="Data mapping (Optional)">
  Map your data to Leap's normalized schema. Create a field mapping table indicating which fields you'll pre-supply vs. collect via LeapConnect.
</Step>

<Step title="Device catalog (Optional)">
  Create your device catalog in Leap with UUIDs and required technical specs for eligibility checks (APL/ENERGY STAR).
</Step>
</Steps>

    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Springfield",
    "state": "IL",
    "postal_code": "62704"
  },
  "building_type": "single_family",
  "device_id": "dev_abc123",

### UX Guidelines

<Tip>
  - Use a clear CTA like **"Claim your rebate"**
  - Set expectations that customers may need to complete after installation
  - Keep offer URLs customer-specific - avoid sharing across users
</Tip>

## Step 3: Complete Filing in LeapConnect

The customer completes their rebate application through LeapConnect.

### Customer Actions

1. **Open their unique `offer_url`**
2. **Provide remaining fields & documents**
3. **Give consent** for partner to share install details

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

- Partner-provided fields appear prefilled
- Leap validates all inputs
- Application is prepared for utility program submission

## Step 4: Finalize Application Data

Partners complete the application with installation details.

### Partner Actions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="calendar" title="Update Partner Fields">
  Add or update partner-side fields such as:
  - Install date
  - Installer details
  - Final invoice
  - Permit information
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="file" title="Upload Documents">
  Upload any partner-only documents if applicable to the rebate program.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="check" title="Confirm Submission">

  **Pro tip:** Automate these updates via API using `customer_id` or your `partner_reference_id`.

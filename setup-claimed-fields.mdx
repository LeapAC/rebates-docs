title: Claimed Fields
description: Plan which application fields your organization will provide on behalf of customers
---

As a partner organization, you can streamline the rebate application process by providing certain customer and installation data directly, reducing the burden on end customers. This guide will help you identify which fields your organization is best positioned to provide.

## How Claimed Fields Work

When you claim ownership of specific fields, those fields will be:
- Pre-populated in applications submitted on behalf of your customers
- Removed from the customer-facing application form
- Your responsibility to keep accurate and up-to-date

<Tip>
Start by claiming fields you already collect as part of your standard business processes. You can always expand your data coverage over time.

## Understanding Field Frequency

Each field displays a frequency indicator to help you prioritize which fields to claim:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="HIGH Frequency" icon="star">
    Requested by most rebate programs. Claiming these will have the biggest impact on customer experience.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MEDIUM Frequency" icon="chart-simple">
    Commonly requested but not universal. Good candidates if you have the data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="LOW Frequency" icon="circle">
    Occasionally requested. Consider claiming if you already collect this data for other purposes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
You don't need to claim all fields in a category. Focus on what you can reliably provide with high accuracy. Start with HIGH frequency fields for maximum impact.
